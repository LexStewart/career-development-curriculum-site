### Career Specialist Support, Communication, & Expectations

* Job search strategy sessions 
* Mock interviews
* Pairin Reports
* Time management
* Job offers
* Any other supports you may need 

*Please note that you should only book with one of them at a time each week*

Communication:

* Questions that you have that are relevant for the whole group, ask in the Cohort Combined Slack channel and tag both Tracey and Ryan
* DM both Tracey and Ryan directly:
  * If you will not be able to attend PD
  * When you get an offer
  * Interview updates and questions 
  * Time-sensitive application questions
  * Any other questions or concerns 

### Deliverables & Due Dates
**Deliverable #1:** Update and complete your branding materials by end of Week 5:

* Targeted Resume
* LinkedIn optimized for job searching
* Terminal portfolio reviewed and published (note: you must request review on your Terminal portfolio and then a member of the Career Dev team will review it and publish it; it isn't fully complete until we publish it)

**Deliverable #2:** Complete this [self-evaluation survey](https://airtable.com/shrsS9pDedt4Jvnkd) by the end of week 6. 

### Weekly Discussion Guidelines & Prompts
Every Wednesday afternoon, you'll meet with other students to discuss and collaborate on your professional development. Read through the overview on the [Homeroom Groups page](/student_discussion_groups/index) to understand what this will look like. Homeroom groups are with your cohort only and happen in Weeks 1-5 while Mix It Up groups are groups that are mixed across the entire student body and happen in Weeks 2 and 4.

* [Mod 4 Homeroom Group Information](/student_discussion_groups/mod4_homeroom_discussion_prompts)
* As student leaders at Turing, Mod 4 students play a unique role in the Mix It Up groups by sharing their experiences in the job search and driving the discussion. Read more here on Mod 4 directions for [Mix It Up groups](/mixed_groups/mixed_mod4_directions).

### Repeating the Module
For students repeating Module 4, they are not required to attend workshops again unless they would like to. Instead, they will meet with the Career Development team, and using their self-evaluation from their first time through Mod 4, they will create specific goals to work on during the module. They will continue to meet with their Homeroom and Mix It Up groups on Wednesday afternoons.
