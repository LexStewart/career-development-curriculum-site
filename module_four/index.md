---

## Overview
Mod 4 is time to review content and strategies in order to refine and execute your job search. 

Find more specifics here on [Mod 4 Key Learning Goals & Outcomes](/module_four/mod4_learning_goals).

### Sessions & Activities
Sessions and activities are customized each module according to what the cohort needs. Here are a few you can expect:

* [Negotiations](/module_four/negotiations)
* [Employer Mock Interviews](/module_four/mod4_mock_interviews)

There will also be at least one guest speaker or panel on one of the following topics:
* Recent alumni experiences
* Networking
* Working with Recruiters
* Non-traditional careers in software

#### Deliverables & Due Dates
By the end of week 5:

* Have a document review with your Career Specialists
* Terminal portfolio updated and published
* Apply to at least 1 job opportunity using the 5 Step Job Search Process

### Weekly Discussion Guidelines & Prompts
Every Wednesday afternoon, you'll meet with other students to discuss and collaborate on your professional development. Read through the overview on the [Homeroom Groups page](/student_discussion_groups/index) to understand what this will look like. Homeroom groups are with your cohort only and happen in Weeks 1-5 while Mix It Up groups are groups that are mixed across the entire student body and happen in Weeks 2 and 4.

* [Mod 4 Homeroom Group Information](/student_discussion_groups/mod4_homeroom_discussion_prompts)
* As student leaders at Turing, Mod 4 students play a unique role in the Mix It Up groups by sharing their experiences in the job search and driving the discussion. Read more here on Mod 4 directions for [Mix It Up groups](/mixed_groups/mixed_mod4_directions).

### Repeating the Module
For students repeating Module 4, they are not required to attend workshops again unless they would like to. Instead, they will meet with the Career Development team, and using their self-evaluation from their first time through Mod 4, they will create specific goals to work on during the module. They will continue to meet with their Homeroom and Mix It Up groups on Wednesday afternoons.
