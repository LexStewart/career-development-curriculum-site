title: Module 4 Professional Development & Job Search Support
---

## Overview
In accordance with our mission, our objective is for all Turing students to have the skills and abilities to pursue full-time employment in high fulfillment technical careers upon graduation. To do this, our curriculum focuses on five specific competencies:

* Networking: Using outreach and networking strategies to make connections in the software industry to support a student’s job search
* Interviewing: The skills needed to thoroughly respond to behavioral interview questions, articulate technical process, and demonstrate technical knowledge through code challenges
* Materials: A student’s branding materials that showcase their work for employers, i.e., LinkedIn, resume, portfolio, cover letter
* Job Search Strategies: A student’s understanding of their own goals and creating a set of steps to achieve them
* Negotiations: Understanding software industry market rates for compensation and the resources needed to negotiate for competitive rates

All of these will be addressed in Module 4 through a [scaffolded approach](https://www.edglossary.org/scaffolding/#:~:text=In%20education%2C%20scaffolding%20refers%20to,independence%20in%20the%20learning%20process.).

**Materials Level III:**
* SIAT describe why they are a good fit for a position based on job description using their identity, strengths, and values
* SIAT create a revised resume that highlights technical skills, transferable skills, and career interests
* SIAT create a final portfolio that showcases projects visually with descriptions that demonstrate their abilities and successes
* SIAT write a cover letter tailored to a specific position at a specific company utilizing best practices for cover letter writing
* SIAT update their LinkedIn profile with all necessary components and with meaningful connections in the industry

**Job Search Strategies Level III:**
* SIAT describe all components of their job search strategy and how they work together 
* SIAT analyze job postings and company websites to identify alignment with interests and skills
* SIAT describe how opportunities they decide to pursue match their career goals and interests
* SIAT describe at least 3 companies/industries they are interested in pursuing
* SIAT create and maintain a job search tracking system

**Negotiations Level III:**
* SIAT discuss effective negotiation strategies
* SIAT create their own strategy for approaching negotiations in their job offers based on their values, identity, and needs
* SIAT analyze job offers and utilize negotiating strategies for approaching them

#### Deliverables & Due Dates
By the end of week 5:

* Terminal portfolio updated and published
* Apply to at least 1 job opportunity using the 5 Step Job Search Process

### Sessions
There will be weekly PD sessions in weeks 1-4. Since this module is focused on refinement of professional development, sessions are customized each module according to what the cohort needs. Some potential topics include:

* [Negotiations] -- coming soon
* [Finalizing Your Career Roadmap] -- coming soon

There will also be at least one guest speaker or panel on one of the following topics:
* Recent alumni experiences
* Networking
* Working with Recruiters
* Non-traditional careers in software

### Weekly Discussion Guidelines & Prompts
Every Wednesday afternoon, you'll meet with other students to discuss and collaborate on your professional development. Read through the overview on the [Homeroom Groups page](/student_discussion_groups/index) to understand what this will look like. Homeroom groups are with your cohort only and happen in Weeks 1-5 while Mix It Up groups are groups that are mixed across the entire student body and happen in Weeks 2 and 4.

* [Mod 4 Homeroom Group Information](/student_discussion_groups/mod4_homeroom_discussion_prompts)
* As student leaders at Turing, Mod 4 students play a unique role in the Mix It Up groups by sharing their experiences in the job search and driving the discussion. Read more here on the structure of [Mix It Up groups](/mixed_groups).

### Repeating the Module
For students repeating Module 4, they are not required to attend workshops again unless they would like to. Instead, they will meet with the Career Development team, and using their self-evaluation from their first time through Mod 4, they will create specific goals to work on during the module. They will continue to meet with their Homeroom and Mix It Up groups on Wednesday afternoons.
