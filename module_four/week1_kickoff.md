## Setting Yourself Up for Success
If you haven't realized it by now, one of the most essential components of a successful job search is time management. This is especially important when you look at your to-do list for the job search and find yourself unsure of where to start. Try these 3 steps:

1. Prioritize tasks:

   * Brain dump all of your tasks. Write down all the things you need to do for your job search, i.e., list companies you want to research, organize the job postings you've found, schedule a call with a networking contact, update your resume, etc.
   * Next, assign numbers to each task in order of priority. What needs to get done first? What is something that needs to be done before you can do something else?
   * Complete your tasks in the order you've given them. Resist the urge to skip around. If you find yourself needing to change priorities, make sure to reorder everything so nothing gets lost in the shuffle. 

2. Time block:

  * Schedule exactly when you will complete a task on your calendar as though it's an appointment or a meeting at your job.
  * Stay focused on just that task during that time block. No multitasking!
  * Turn off Slack, put your phone on silent, and close your email during this time block to keep yourself focused.

3. Find Your Focus:

  * Decide what your non-negotiable task is for the day. What do you want to get accomplished today?
  * Set your intention for your work time focused on that accomplishment
  * Consider when you work best and how you want to tackle your to-do list. When you have shorter work times, focus on smaller tasks. When you have longer time times, dig into bigger tasks

Here's an example of how you could block out specific time to work on your resume for a position during a typical week in Mod 4:
