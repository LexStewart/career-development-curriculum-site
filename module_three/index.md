title: Module 3 Professional Development
---

## Overview
In accordance with our mission, our objective is for all Turing students to have the skills and abilities to pursue full-time employment in high fulfillment technical careers upon graduation. To do this, our curriculum focuses on five specific competencies:

* Networking: Using outreach and networking strategies to make connections in the software industry to support a student’s job search
* Interviewing: The skills needed to thoroughly respond to behavioral interview questions, articulate technical process, and demonstrate technical knowledge through code challenges
* Materials: A student’s branding materials that showcase their work for employers, i.e., LinkedIn, resume, portfolio, cover letter
* Job Search Strategies: A student’s understanding of their own goals and creating a set of steps to achieve them
* Negotiations: Understanding software industry market rates for compensation and the resources needed to negotiate for competitive rates

All of these will be addressed in Module 3 through a [scaffolded approach](https://www.edglossary.org/scaffolding/#:~:text=In%20education%2C%20scaffolding%20refers%20to,independence%20in%20the%20learning%20process.). 

### Key Learning Goals
Core Competencies of Module 3:
* Utilize community for support in job search
* Continue utilizing mentor for job search support
* Apply strategies to personal job search

### Module 3 Outcomes
By the end of Module 3, we aim for students to achieve [Level III readiness](/standards_and_rubric/index) in Networking, Interviewing, Materials, and Job Search Strategies.

(Note: SIAT = Student is able to)

**Networking Level III:**
* SIAT identify contacts outside their immediate network from companies/industries that align with their interests
* SIAT identify relevant contacts from companies with positions they want to pursue
* SIAT research company and contact to come up with relevant questions for coffee meetings or job shadows
* SIAT analyze takeaways from conversations to apply to own career goals and use in job application

**Interviewing Level III:**
* SIAT analyze strengths and apply them to new contexts in their current work at Turing and achieving their career goals
* SIAT describe their goals for their career and values that align with a specific company they plan to interview with
* SIAT make connections between skills/mindsets from previous career to specific position/company in order to describe why they are a good fit
* SIAT provide relevant examples/utilize STAR in either interview prep or real interviews
* SIAT demonstrate reflection on and improvement in interview responses
* SIAT reflect on and describe their approach to problem-solving in assessments or other live coding sessions

**Materials Level III:**
* SIAT describe why they are a good fit for a position based on job description using their identity, strengths, and values
* SIAT create a revised resume that highlights technical skills, transferable skills, and career interests
* SIAT create a final portfolio that showcases projects visually with descriptions that demonstrate their abilities and successes
* SIAT write a cover letter tailored to a specific position at a specific company utilizing best practices for cover letter writing
* SIAT update their LinkedIn profile with all necessary components and with meaningful connections in the industry

**Job Search Strategies Level III:**
* SIAT describe all components of their job search strategy and how they work together 
* SIAT analyze job postings and company websites to identify alignment with interests and skills
* SIAT describe how opportunities they decide to pursue match their career goals and interests
* SIAT describe at least 3 companies/industries they are interested in pursuing
* SIAT create and maintain a job search tracking system

#### Deliverables to be completed by end of Module 3
* Resume updated
* Terminal portfolio created and published
* Cover letter draft reviewed by peers in week 5
* Students complete [end of mod self-evaluation survey](https://airtable.com/shrBZWvdZfHSeey57) for CD team to assess support needs
* Portfolio review that includes self-evaluation

### What This Will Look Like Week-by-Week
* Sessions:
    * Week 1: [Resumes & Portfolios](/module_three/week_1_resumes_and_portfolios)
    * Week 2: [Building Connection: Part II] -- Coming soon
    * Week 3: [The Application Process](/module_three/week_3_application_process_session)
* Activities:
    * Week 4: Job Shadow
    * Week 4: Mock Interviews -- Coming soon
    * Week 5: [End of Module Working Group](/module_three/week_5_working_group)

### Weekly Discussion Guidelines & Prompts
Every Wednesday afternoon, you'll meet with other students to discuss and collaborate on your professional development. Read through the overview on the [Homeroom Groups page](/student_discussion_groups/index) to understand what this will look like. Homeroom groups are with your cohort only and happen in Weeks 1-5 while Mix It Up groups are groups that are mixed across the entire student body and happen in Weeks 2 and 4.

* [Mix It Up Information](/mixed_groups)

### Repeating the Module
For students repeating Module 3, they are not required to attend workshops again unless they would like to. Instead, they will create specific goals to work on during the module [using this plan](/module_three/m3_repeat_plan). They will continue to meet with their Homeroom and Mix It Up groups on Wednesday afternoons.
