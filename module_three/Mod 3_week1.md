## Application
Solo Activity
Look at a few different resumes on Terminal but think about
* How are they telling their story through their resume?
* How are they describing their projects? What would you do similarly or differently?
* What makes them stand out as a candidate compared to others?

What do you want your profile to say about you?

###  About me section for Terminal Portfolio:
Write out a rough draft of your professional story considering using this framework:

* What is your career story about your past, present, and future that you want to share with employers? 
* What prior experiences are relevant and transferrabe to the tech industry?
* What impact you want to have in software development?
* What kind of company and culture are you passionate about adding value for?

### Answer the following questions:
* Who am I? 
* Why am I in this field? 
* What's next for me? 

Show readers who you are by telling a story of your journey into tech. Share enough for them to want to hear and learn more! 

Your terminal about me, LinkedIN summary, and resume summary (if you chose to use one) should all be slightly different. 
* First, you want the reader to learn something new with each profile
* Second, each summary has a different purpose; think about the audience
  * Resume summaries should tell why you are the best candidate for the role relevant to the job description. 
  * LinkedIn summaries allows you to add a personal touch in addition to relevant skills and experiences that will attract recruiters and hiring managers.
  * Terminal is similiar to the LinkedIn audience; employers want to know your backstory, your value proposition and what's next for you as a developer.
