title: Mod 1 Homeroom Groups Guidelines & Prompts
---

### Guidelines
You and a small group of your cohortmates make up your homeroom. You'll meet on Wednesdays to discuss and collaborate on your professional development.

With your group, we recommend setting norms for your group. These could include:

* What communication and feedback looks like within your group
* How to hold each other accountable
* If and how you will communicate outside of Wednesday group time. We encourage groups to form Slack channels if they would like!

Skip down to:
* [Week 3](#week-3)
* [Week 5](#week-5)

### Week 1 Prompts & Structure (60 mins)
1. Set norms for how you want to work together (15 mins)

2. Choose from the following discussion questions on strengths that the group would like to discuss. Choose several or just a few and share your thoughts (20-30 mins):

   * What would it take for you to build more awareness of your strengths?
   * What would you like to focus on in your professional development at Turing?
   * What can make it challenging to recognize your strengths? How can you work through those challenges?
   * Do you ever see yourself overusing certain strengths? In what circumstances would you want to use them less and amplify other strengths? How could you adjust your approach in those instances?
   * What can make it challenging to recognize your strengths? How can you work through those challenges?
   * Do you ever see yourself overusing certain strengths? In what circumstances would you want to use them less and amplify other strengths? How could you adjust your approach in those instances?
   * Is there any particular strength you’d like to sharpen while you’re at Turing? Any area you consider a weakness that you’d like to strengthen?

3. Write out action steps you can take to develop awareness of your strengths and any challenges. How could you be aware of the progress you are making? If you are repeating the module, reflect on how you used your strengths last module. What changes do you want to make to your approach for this module? (10-15 mins)

4. If you're comfortable, share some of your ideas with your group! (5 mins)
