title: Mod 1 Homeroom Groups Guidelines & Prompts
---

### Guidelines
You and a small group of your cohortmates make up your homeroom. You'll meet on Wednesdays to discuss and collaborate on your professional development.

With your group, we recommend setting norms for your group. These could include:

* What communication and feedback looks like within your group
* How to hold each other accountable
* If and how you will communicate outside of Wednesday group time. We encourage groups to form Slack channels if they would like!

Skip down to:
* [Week 2](#week-2)
* [Week 3](#week-3)
* [Week 4](#week-4)
* [Week 5](#week-5)

### Week 1 Prompts & Structure (60 mins)
1. Set norms for how you want to work together (15 mins)
2. Choose from the following discussion questions on strengths that the group would like to discuss. Choose several or just a few and share your thoughts (20-30 mins):

  * What would it take for you to build more awareness of your strengths?
  * What would you like to focus on in your professional development at Turing?
  * What can make it challenging to recognize your strengths? How can you work through those challenges?
  * Do you ever see yourself overusing certain strengths? In what circumstances would you want to use them less and amplify other strengths? How could you adjust your approach in those instances?
  * What can make it challenging to recognize your strengths? How can you work through those challenges?
  * Do you ever see yourself overusing certain strengths? In what circumstances would you want to use them less and amplify other strengths? How could you adjust your approach in those instances?
  * Is there any particular strength you’d like to sharpen while you’re at Turing? Any area you consider a weakness that you’d like to strengthen?
3. (10-15 min) Write out action steps you can take to develop awareness of your strengths and any challenges (recommended: use your career journal that you started in Mod 0 to record your reflections). How could you be aware of the progress you are making? 
4. 
If you are repeating the module, reflect on how you used your strengths last module. What changes do you want to make to your approach for this module?

### Week 2 Prompts & Structure (30 mins) <a name="week-2"></a>
1. Revisit norms (5 mins)
2. Your activity for the week is to [work on networking](/module_one/week_2_networking_activity). Discuss your progress on the activity (25 mins):

* Have you had your networking call for this week yet? 
* If so, what did you discuss with your contact and what were your main takeaways? 
* If you haven’t had the call yet, when are you planning to set it up? Could you use support from this group to send the message to your contact?
* How do you feel about networking in general? What do you think it will take for you to build your network while you’re at Turing? What kind of support do you need in this area? How can this group provide that support for each other?  

### Week 3 Prompts & Structure (60 mins) <a name="week-3"></a>
1. Revisit norms (5 mins)
2. Start off by discussing (10 mins)
   * How is your career story coming along? 
   * Are you stuck on any particular part that you would like to discuss? 
   * What parts do you feel really good about? 
3. [Look through the guidelines for LinkedIn here](/resources/branding_resources) and update your profile (15-20 mins)
4. Share your LinkedIn profiles with each other and provide feedback for one another (15-20 mins)
5. Update your LinkedIn based on that feedback (10-15 mins)

### Week 4 Prompts & Structure (30 mins) <a name="week-4"></a>
1. Take 10 minutes to work on your [networking tracker from this week’s activity](/module_one/week_4_networking_activity)
2. Share (10 mins):
  * What have you learned so far about your current network?
  * Have you communicated with people you know about your new career in software development? How did you let them know?
  * Networking is just another word for building relationships. What are all the ways you’re currently building relationships at Turing? How could you turn to these relationships for support while at Turing? How could you turn to these relationships for support in your job search? 
3. Prep for Mix It Up groups by sharing (5 mins):
  * What group are you in today?
  * What would you like to learn today? 
  * How will you contribute to the conversation?
4. Take a 5-min pom and then join the zoom link in your Slack group for your Mix It Up group!
