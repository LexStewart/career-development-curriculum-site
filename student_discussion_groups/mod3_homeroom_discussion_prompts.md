title: Mod 3 Homeroom Groups Guidelines & Prompts
---

### Guidelines
You and a small group of your cohortmates make up your homeroom. You'll meet on Wednesdays to discuss and collaborate on your professional development.

To start off Mod 3, we recommend revisiting norms with your group. These could include:

* What communication and feedback looks like within your group
* How to hold each other accountable
* If and how you will communicate outside of Wednesday group time. We encourage groups to form Slack channels if they would like!

Skip down to:
* [Week 2](#week-2)
* [Week 3](#week-3)
* [Week 4](#week-4)
* [Week 5](#week-5)

### Week 1 Prompts & Structure (60 mins)
1. Revisit norms for how your group wants to work together (15 mins):
  * What was helpful last mod?
  * What do you want to keep doing?
  * What do you want to stop doing?
  * What new ways do you want to collaborate with each other?

2. Work on filling out the [career roadmap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yMlss8updK2zaTVPwUzcoBG2ws5zBWENjE2a-SjSPeM/edit?usp=sharing) to the best of your ability (make a copy) (15-20 mins)
3. Take turns sharing your takeaways from the career roadmap (15-20 mins)
4. As a group discuss: (10-15 mins)
  * Based on what you filled out in the roadmap so far, what kinds of jobs will you be targeting?
  * What should your resume include to show that these are the jobs you’re both qualified for and seeking?  
  * What questions or concerns do you have about building your tech resume? Surface them with the group here and then bring them with you to the session tomorrow!
