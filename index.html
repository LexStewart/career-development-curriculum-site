    <h2>Assessment</h2>
    <p>Every Monday, students will have a workshop on a specific professional development topic to provide them with support in each of these areas. The workshops will provide space for whole group and small group discussion, readings, and reflection time along with resources and strategies for implementing new ideas.</p>
    <p>Throughout the rest of the week, students will be able to put this learning into practice through reflections in their career journals. What is a career journal? It's a document where the student can create a road map for their career goals through self-reflection, prompts, and questions.</p>
    <p>The Career Dev team will review each students' journal reflections weekly and again at the end of each module to assess their progress and provide tailored support when needed.</p>
