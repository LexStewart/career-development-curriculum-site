    <h2>Learning Goals & Competencies</h2>
    <p>In accordance with our mission, our objective is for all Turing students to have the skills and abilities to pursue full-time employment in high fulfillment technical careers upon graduation. To do this, our curriculum focuses on five specific competencies:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><em>Networking:</em> Using outreach and networking strategies to make connections in the software industry to support a student’s job search</li>
      <li><em>Interviewing:</em> The skills needed to thoroughly respond to behavioral interview questions, articulate technical process, and demonstrate technical knowledge through code challenges</li>
      <li><em>Materials:</em> A student’s branding materials that showcase their work for employers, i.e., LinkedIn, resume, portfolio, cover letter</li>
      <li><em>Job Search Strategies:</em> A student’s understanding of their own goals and creating a set of steps to achieve them</li>
      <li><em>Negotiations:</em> Understanding software industry market rates for compensation and the resources needed to negotiate for competitive rates</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Application</h2>
    <p>Students will have regular sessions and activities to complete </p>
    <p>Throughout the rest of the week, students will be able to put this learning into practice through reflections in their career journals. What is a career journal? It's a document where the student can create a road map for their career goals through self-reflection, prompts, and questions.</p>
    <p>The Career Dev team will review each students' journal reflections weekly and again at the end of each module to assess their progress and provide tailored support when needed.</p>
