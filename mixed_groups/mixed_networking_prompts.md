## Structuring the Conversation
Mix It Up group conversations are 30 minutes long and will be led by a Mod 4 (or sometimes Mod 3) student. Here is a suggested structure for your group to follow when meeting. 

### Introductions (2-5 mins)
You're in a mixed group of people across modules and programs. Start by getting to know each other and make space for everyone to share:

* Names
* Pronouns
* Program
* Cohort
* How confident you feel about networking on a scale of 1-5

### Mod 4 Student Leader(s) Share Their Experiences (8-10 mins)
The student lead chooses 1-2 of the following questions to respond to and share their experiences with the group:

* How have you been successful with networking? Share a recent success and what steps you took that made it successful.
* What is your process when it comes to networking?
* What’s been challenging for you when it comes to networking? How are you working to overcome those challenges?
* What advice do you have for others at Turing when it comes to networking?

### Group Discussion (15 mins)
There are several components of networking that could be helpful to discuss as a group today. From the following topics, choose 1 as a group and try out the activities listed at the link below:

* [Finding the right person to network with](#right-person)
* [Sending a message to a contact](#messaging)
* [Preparing for phone calls or coffee meetings](#preparing)

### Close Out & Next Steps (5 mins)
Take time to wrap up any conversation threads! Decide how you'd like to continue the conversation (if you want) with each other beyond today's discussion. Add each other on LinkedIn. 

## Activity Prompts

### Finding the Right Person to Network With <a name="right-person"></a>
You know you want to network, but you're not sure who to reach out to.

Everyone in the group find someone they want to network with. As a group, walk through the steps with each other to do research into a contact, craft a message, update your notes/tracker, etc.



### Messaging <a name="messaging"></a>
A key component of networking is personalization, both in your initial message to someone and in how you conduct the conversation with them. 

1. Mod 4 student lead: share a recent message you have sent to a networking contact. Discuss how to prepare for the conversation with this contact. 
    * What steps did you take if you’ve already had the conversation? 
    * If you are sending the message today, what steps will you take to prepare for the conversation?
2. Mod 4 student lead: solicit advice from the group on how to write a message you want to send.
