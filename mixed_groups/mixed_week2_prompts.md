title: Mix It Up Week 2
subheading: Balancing PD and the Job Search during Turing
---

## Overview
You are meeting with your mixed group for one hour today to collaborate on strategies for how to balance PD and your job search while in the Turing program. Below is an outline for how we encourage you to use this time, but we also encourage you as a group to think about what you'd like to accomplish together. 

### Introductions (10 mins)
You're in a mixed group of people across modules and programs. Start by getting to know each other and make space for everyone to share:

* Names
* Pronouns
* Program & Cohort
* What brought you to Turing?

### Establishing Group Norms (8-10 mins)
Here are some suggested norms to start with:

* **Make space.** Everyone should be given a chance to share.
* **Be present.** Take a break from your projects and show up to this conversation.
* **Make this time valuable.** What intention can you set for your time today? How can you demonstrate that you value the other students in your group? How can they let yoU know that they value you?

Please discuss any additional norms you would like to set as a group!

### Group Discussion(40 mins)
In the last 40 minutes of the discussion time, please plan to discuss the following topics:

1. **Learning Goals:**

   * Individually, write down one thing you'd like to get out of today's discussion around the topics of time management, resiliency, and self-care. If you feel comfortable, please share this intention with the group as you get started. 

2. **Time Management.** First, assess your approach to time management and think about how you could create more space to incorporate PD into your time at Turing. 

   * What is your current approach to managing your time at Turing? What tools do you use? What's effective or not effective for you? What tips could you share with each other?
   * When it comes to making time for PD, how do you approach that? What are the biggest challenges here? 
   * If you were to tweak how you spend your time to build a little more time for something PD-related (networking, working on your LinkedIn or resume, researching companies, going through the resources on this site, etc.), what steps could you take? What support do you need for that?   
   * **Action Step:** Take 5 minutes to set up different systems (time blocking on your calendar, making a to-do task list, etc.)

3. **Resiliency.** A key component to the job search is developing a high sense of resiliency in order to bounce back from rejections and use your strengths to help you persevere. Talking about strategies here will not only help you with your storytelling skills, it will also help you recognize what you're doing well and how you could contribute to the group.

   * What is something you're doing well at Turing? Consider all aspects of Turing: project management, teamwork, organization, time management, learning strategies, etc. How could you apply that strength to the job search? How will it serve you? 
   * When things are challenging at Turing, how do you keep yourself going? How could you apply that mindset to the job search?
   * Self-care is an important piece of resiliency. How do you take care of yourself when things get hard? What are some tips you can share with the group for making space for self-care during Turing? 

4. **Collaboration.** As a group, work together to brainstorm a list of tips based on your conversation today using a [jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/) or a [gist](https://gist.github.com/). 

   * **Time Management:** What are your 1-2 top pieces of advice for effective time management for PD and the job search?
   * **Resiliency:** What are your 1-2 top pieces of advice for persevering through challenges at Turing and on the job search?
   * **Self-care:** What are your 1-2 top ideas for self-care activities to keep you going in your Turing journey and job search?

 If you feel comfortable, please post this list in the #on-campus channel on Slack!

### Close Out & Next Steps (5 mins)
Review the learning goals you set out to achieve today. Did you make progress? What are you proud of? What wins can you take away from this conversation today? Finally, how could you continue building these relationships outside of today's conversation?
