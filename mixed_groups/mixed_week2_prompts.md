## Structuring the Conversation
You are meeting with your mixed group for an hour today....

### Introductions (10 mins)
You're in a mixed group of people across modules and programs. Start by getting to know each other and make space for everyone to share:

* Names
* Pronouns
* Program & Cohort
* 

### Establishing Group Norms (8-10 mins)
Here are some suggested norms to start with:

* **Make space.** Everyone should be given a chance to share.
* **Be present.** Take a break from your projects and show up to this conversation.
* **Make this time valuable.** What intention can you set for your time today? How can you demonstrate that you value the other students in your group? How can they let yuo know that they value you?

Please discuss any additional norms you would like to set as a group!

### Group Discussion(40 mins)

1. Learning Goals

2. Time Management

3. Resiliency

### Close Out & Next Steps (5 mins)
