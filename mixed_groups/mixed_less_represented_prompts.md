## Structuring the Conversation
Mix It Up group conversations are 30 minutes long and will be led by a Mod 4 (or sometimes Mod 3) student. Here is a suggested structure for your group to follow when meeting. 

### Introductions (2-5 mins)
You're in a mixed group of people across modules and programs. Start by getting to know each other and make space for everyone to share:

* Names
* Pronouns
* Program
* Cohort
* What you're hoping to experience with this group today

### Setting Norms (8-10 mins)
Everyone in this group is different and will have different needs in the job search. This group is not meant to generalize the job search experience. It is meant to be a space to share experiences and how to approach the job search from different angles to help find a more inclusive and equitable workplace.

Keeping that purpose in mind, what norms would you like to set as a group for this space?

### Group Discussion: Suggested Topics (15 mins)
There are several components of job searching that could be helpful to discuss as a group today. From the following topics, choose 1 as a group and try out the activities listed at the link below:

* **Defining your job search.** 
  * What are your needs in a company and in your job search overall? What kind of support do you need from your peers and the Career Dev team?
  * How could this group support each other in your job search?
 
* **Authenticity in your job search**
  * How do you feel about being your full self in the job search and workplace? 
  * What concerns do you have about that? 
  * What strategies have been helpful for you in the past in this area that you could share with the group?
 
* **Mentorship**
  * Do you currently have a mentor who understands your needs in the job search? If not, how could you go about finding one? Check out some of these networking groups listed here under [Specific Groups](/resources/outreach_networking_resources)

* **Research**
  * How could you conduct research into companies’ hiring practices and culture? What resources could you share with each other here? How could you support each other with this research?
  * Here are some suggested resources:
    * [Diversity Inc’s Top 50 Companies for Diversity](https://www.diversityinc.com/about-the-diversityinc-top-50-process/)
    * [Searching for companies by key values](https://www.keyvalues.com/)

### Close Out & Next Steps (5 mins)
Take time to wrap up any conversation threads! Decide how you'd like to continue the conversation (if you want) with each other beyond today's discussion and if you'd like to support each other moving forward.
