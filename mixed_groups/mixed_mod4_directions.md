## Your Role as a Leader
As Mod 4 students, you are now the most experienced students in the Turing community. You have learned so much over the last several months from how to code to how to communicate better. You have completed all PD sessions and activities for the 5 PD competencies, and you have put together the pieces for your job search. Because of this experience, students in lower modules will benefit greatly from talking to you. 

## Before the Discussions

### Logistics
You'll be put into a Slack group with the other people in your Mix It Up group prior to the group time and receive information on which breakout room you'll be assigned from your SLC study hall link. Please make sure to share that information in your Slack group so that everyone knows where to go. 

### Selecting your Topic & Deciding What to Share
**Do I have to be an expert on my topic?**
No. If you select a topic that you want to work on, start by sharing what barriers you are experiencing with that topic and discuss ideas on how to improve with the group. 

**If I feel do comfortable on a specific topic, how should I share my experience?**


**Do I need to prepare anything?**
Nothing formal. You'll have time in your Homeroom Groups prior to the Mix It Up groups to prep what you'd like to share, but this is meant to be an informal discussion with a group of fellow students -- no formal presentation required!

Here are the topics:
 
* [Networking](/mixed_groups/mixed_networking_prompts)
* [Interviewing](/mixed_groups/mixed_interviewing_prompts)
* [Materials](/mixed_groups/mixed_materials_prompts)
* [Job Search Strategies](/mixed_groups/mixed_jss_prompts)
* [Negotiations](/mixed_groups/mixed_negotiations_prompts)
* [Specific technical interest](/mixed_groups/mixed_tech_interest_prompts)
* [Specific industry interest](/mixed_groups/mixed_industry_interest_prompts)
* [Identifying as someone less represented in tech](/mixed_groups/mixed_less_represented_prompts)

### Structure for Leading the Discussion
1. Introduce yourself with your name, pronouns, program, cohort, and how confident you feel about your topic on a scale of 1-5, and then ask others in the group to do the same.

2. Depending on your topic, you'll start with different questions, but you can 

How do you do research into companies? How do you approach the application? 
What strategies have been successful for you with your job search so far?
What is challenging about figuring out a strategy for the job search? 
What advice do you have for others at Turing when it comes to strategies for the job search?
