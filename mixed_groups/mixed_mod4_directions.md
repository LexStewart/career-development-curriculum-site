## Your Role
As Mod 4 students, you are now the most experienced students in the Turing community. You have learned so much over the last several months from how to code to how to communicate better. You have completed all PD sessions and activities for the 5 PD competencies, and you have put together the pieces for your job search. Because of this experience, students in lower modules will benefit greatly from talking to you. 

## Before the Discussions

### Logistics
You'll be put into a Slack group with the other people in your Mix It Up group prior to the group time and receive information on which breakout room you'll be assigned from your SLC study hall link. Please make sure to share that information in your Slack group so that everyone knows where to go. 

### Selecting your Topic & Deciding What to Share
**Do I have to be an expert on my topic?**
No. If you select a topic that you want to work on, start by sharing what barriers you are experiencing with that topic and discuss ideas on how to improve with the group. 

**If I feel do have experience with a specific topic, how should I share my experience?**
Talk about what strategies you have used. For example, with networking, how have you approached networking? What was successful for you and what wasn't? What advice would you give to lower mod students about networking at their stage in the program? 

**If I identify as someone who is less represented in tech and choose that group, how should I "lead" it?**
This group is run in a more open-ended format, and you are not expected to lead the group. You are still expected to post which breakout room the group will go to in the Slack message.

**Do I need to prepare anything?**
Nothing formal. You'll have time in your Homeroom Groups prior to the Mix It Up groups to prep what you'd like to share, but this is meant to be an informal discussion with a group of fellow students -- no formal presentation required!

Here are the topics:
 
* [Networking](/mixed_groups/mixed_networking_prompts)
* [Interviewing](/mixed_groups/mixed_interviewing_prompts)
* [Materials](/mixed_groups/mixed_materials_prompts)
* [Job Search Strategies](/mixed_groups/mixed_jss_prompts)
* [Negotiations](/mixed_groups/mixed_negotiations_prompts)
* [Specific industry interest](/mixed_groups/mixed_industry_interest_prompts)
* [Identifying as someone less represented in tech](/mixed_groups/mixed_less_represented_prompts)

### Structure for Leading the Discussion
1. Introduce yourself with your name, pronouns, program, cohort, and how confident you feel about your topic on a scale of 1-5, and then ask others in the group to do the same.

2. You'll start the conversation by choosing questions from the prompts (see above) to respond to. 

3. Everyone else will have an opportunity to contribute to the discussion as well.

Bonus:
* Ask the group to share specific resources in your group Slack channel.
* Follow up with each other outside of this timeframe.
* Add each other on LinkedIn.
