## Structuring the Conversation
Mix It Up group conversations are 30 minutes long and will be led by a Mod 4 (or sometimes Mod 3) student. Here is a suggested structure for your group to follow when meeting. 

### Introductions (2-5 mins)
You're in a mixed group of people across modules and programs. Start by getting to know each other and make space for everyone to share:

* Names
* Pronouns
* Program
* Cohort
* How confident you feel about applying for software jobs on a scale of 1-5

### Mod 4 Student Leader(s) Share Their Experiences (8-10 mins)
The student lead chooses 1-2 of the following questions to respond to and share their experiences with the group:

* How do you do research into companies? How do you approach the application? 
* What strategies have been successful for you with your job search so far?
* What is challenging about figuring out a strategy for the job search? 
* What advice do you have for others at Turing when it comes to strategies for the job search?

### Group Discussion: Building Job Search Strategies (15 mins)
There are several components of job search strategies that could be helpful to discuss as a group today. **From the following topics, choose 1 as a group and try out the activities listed below:**

1. **Reflect on previous successes.** As a group, discuss:

* In a lot of ways, the job search as a software developer is not much different from other job searches. What has been successful for you in previous job searches? Why was that successful and how could you apply that to a strategy for this job search now? 

2. **Create your career vision.**

* What are your current goals or vision for your new career? If you don't know the answer, what How can that help you formulate a strong job search strategy? Solicit ideas from the rest of the group.
What are all the ways you could find out about job opportunities beyond job boards?
If you were to create a step by step strategy for applying to jobs, what are the steps you would include? Are there any that are more challenging for you to complete (an example of this might be networking)? If so, how will you find support for those steps? 


As a group, build a job search strategy:
Regardless of what mod you’re currently in, what have you learned about successful job search strategies in the tech industry?
Look through the resources here. How could you use them to have a successful strategy?
Turing job searches are most successful and quickest when students collaborate with each other and share resources. What could that look like across programs and modules? How could you continue this idea sharing beyond today?
4. I Do Activity: (10 mins)
Everyone in the group spends 5 mins checking out more resources. See if you can find a company you’re interested in learning more about! 
After 5 mins, share what you found with the group!



### Close Out & Next Steps (5 mins)
Take time to wrap up any conversation threads! Decide how you'd like to continue the conversation (if you want) with each other beyond today's discussion. Add each other on LinkedIn.
