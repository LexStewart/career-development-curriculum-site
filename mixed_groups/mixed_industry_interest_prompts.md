## Structuring the Conversation
Mix It Up group conversations are 30 minutes long and will be led by a Mod 4 (or sometimes Mod 3) student. Here is a suggested structure for your group to follow when meeting. 

### Introductions (2-5 mins)
You're in a mixed group of people across modules and programs. Start by getting to know each other and make space for everyone to share:

* Names
* Pronouns
* Program
* Cohort
* Why you chose this specific group

### Group Discussion: Research & Adding to your Strategy (20 mins)
Depending on which group you're in, use the links below to dig into some resources:

* [EdTech](/resources/edtech_resources)
* [Civic Tech](/resources/civic_tech_resources)
* [Health Tech](/resources/health_tech_resources)
* [FinTech](/resources/fintech_resources)
* [Consulting](/resources/consulting_resources)

As a group, discuss:

* What interests you about this field? How can you incorporate your interest in this industry into your professional story? 
* What steps could you take to learn more about this industry? Who should you network with? Share tips with each other.
* Who from the Turing alumni network works in this industry? How could you find out?
* Explore some of the resources at the link for your group above. Share takeaways with each other.

### Close Out & Next Steps (5 mins)
Take time to wrap up any conversation threads! Decide how you'd like to continue the conversation (if you want) with each other beyond today's discussion. Add each other on LinkedIn.
