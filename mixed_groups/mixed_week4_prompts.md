## Structuring the Conversation
You are meeting with your mixed group for an hour today....

### Introductions (10 mins)
You're in a mixed group of people across modules and programs. Start by getting to know each other and make space for everyone to share:

* Names
* Pronouns
* Program & Cohort
* 

### Establishing Group Norms (8-10 mins)
Here are some suggested norms to start with:

* **Make space.** Everyone should be given a chance to share.
* **Be present.** Take a break from your projects and show up to this conversation.
* **Make this time valuable.** What intention can you set for your time today? How can you demonstrate that you value the other students in your group? How can they let you know that they value you?

Please discuss any additional norms you would like to set as a group!

### Group Discussion(40 mins)

1. Mod 4 experiences and advice
2. Reflecting on wins and progress
3. Creating feasible goals to work towards for the rest of the module based on where you are
4. Discuss challenges to be aware of, resources you can share with each other, and first steps to take

### Close Out & Next Steps (5 mins)
How can you check in with each other again and hold each other accountable?
