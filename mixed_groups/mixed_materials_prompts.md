## Structuring the Conversation
Mix It Up group conversations are 30 minutes long and will be led by a Mod 4 (or sometimes Mod 3) student. Here is a suggested structure for your group to follow when meeting. 

### Introductions (2-5 mins)
You're in a mixed group of people across modules and programs. Start by getting to know each other and make space for everyone to share:

* Names
* Pronouns
* Program
* Cohort
* How confident you feel about your application materials (LinkedIn, resume, portfolio, cover letters) on a scale of 1-5

### Mod 4 Student Leader(s) Share Their Experiences (8-10 mins)
The student lead chooses 1-2 of the following questions to respond to and share their experiences with the group:

* What has been successful for you when it comes to using your LinkedIn/resume/cover letters to share your story? What helpful advice have you received?
* What has been challenging for you in this area? How are you working to overcome these challenges?
* What advice do you have for others at Turing when it comes to preparing your materials?

### Group Discussion: Creating Interview Prep Documents & Practicing (15 mins)
There are several components of interviewing that could be helpful to discuss as a group today. **From the following topics, choose 1 as a group and try out the activities listed below:**

1. **Resumes.** Mod 3 or 4 student shares their resume with the group. The group provides feedback on:

* What can you learn about this person from their resume?
* What catches your attention?
* What questions do you still have about their experience/story after looking at the resume?

2. **LinkedIn.** Everyone in the group take turns sharing LinkedIn profiles with each other. The group provides feedback on:

* What can you learn about this person from their resume?
* What catches your attention?
* What questions do you still have about their experience/story after looking at the resume?

Connect with each other on LinkedIn!

3. **Cover Letters.** Mod 3 or 4 student shares a cover letter with the group. The group provides feedback on:

* How does this cover letter communicate that the applicant understands the company and their needs?
* If you were the hiring manager for this position, what makes you excited about this candidate? 

4. **Portfolios.**. Check out some of the portfolios up on [Terminal](https://terminal.turing.edu) -- students create these starting in Mod 3, and Turing staff shares these with employers. The group discusses:

* What trends do you notice that make them effective in sharing their story and skills? 
* What can you incorporate into your own portfolio to help you stand out as a candidate?

### Close Out & Next Steps (5 mins)
Take time to wrap up any conversation threads! Decide how you'd like to continue the conversation (if you want) with each other beyond today's discussion. Add each other on LinkedIn.
