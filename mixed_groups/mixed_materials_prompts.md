## Structuring the Conversation
Mix It Up group conversations are 30 minutes long and will be led by a Mod 4 (or sometimes Mod 3) student. Here is a suggested structure for your group to follow when meeting. 

### Introductions (2-5 mins)
You're in a mixed group of people across modules and programs. Start by getting to know each other and make space for everyone to share:

* Names
* Pronouns
* Program
* Cohort
* How confident you feel about your application materials (LinkedIn, resume, portfolio, cover letters) on a scale of 1-5

### Mod 4 Student Leader(s) Share Their Experiences (8-10 mins)
The student lead chooses 1-2 of the following questions to respond to and share their experiences with the group:

* What has been successful for you when it comes to using your LinkedIn/resume/cover letters to share your story?
* What has been challenging for you in this area?
* What advice do you have for others at Turing when it comes to preparing your materials?

### Group Discussion: Creating Interview Prep Documents & Practicing (15 mins)
There are several components of interviewing that could be helpful to discuss as a group today. From the following topics, choose 1 as a group and try out the activities listed at the link below:

1. **Talk about it.** Build awareness of your interview skills:

* How are you already actively working on interview skills at Turing?
* When you donâ€™t know how to answer a technical question in an interview, what can you do?
* What are some effective ways to talk about projects at Turing in interviews?
* What do you think are the 3 most important things an employer would want to know about a Turing graduate? How should you make sure to communicate that in an interview? 

2. **Prep for it.** Spend 10 minutes building an interview prep document using the following prompts and then share with each other your takeaways from this prep work.

* 

3. **Practice.** Using the [interview questions in the bottom of this page](/resources/interview_prep_resources), take turns asking each other interview questions and giving responses. Provide feedback for each other that is specific, actionable, and kind. 

Share your professional story as a short pitch. How can you communicate this story through your LinkedIn or resume? Could you help from the group on how to do this better? Share feedback and ideas with each other.
The key to a good cover letter is showing that you understand the company and their needs. What steps could you take to do that research? If you were a hiring manager reading a cover letter, what would you want to read in order to be excited about the candidate?
Check out some of the portfolios up on Terminal. What trends do you notice that make them effective in sharing their story and skills? 
4. Here are resources on branding, resumes, and cover letters 


### Close Out & Next Steps (5 mins)
Take time to wrap up any conversation threads! Decide how you'd like to continue the conversation (if you want) with each other beyond today's discussion. Add each other on LinkedIn.
