title: Mix It Up
---

## Overview
In addition to the Homeroom Groups with your cohortmates, you also have an opportunity to meet with and collaborate with students across modules and across programs -- we call this Mix It Up! On Wednesdays in Weeks 2 and 4, you'll first meet with your Homeroom Groups for 30 minutes and then transition to your Mix It Up group for the second 30 minutes. 

### Why do this?
Our data shows that student collaboration and connection is a strong indicator of a quick and satisfactory job search. Meeting others within Turing allows you to strengthen your bonds to the community and network in a low-stress environment. 

### What will you talk about?
Prior to weeks 2 and 4, every student will be able to fill out a survey with their top preference for discussion topics. These topics will be chosen from the 5 PD competencies (Networking, Interviewing, Materials, Job Search Strategies, and Negotiations), industry or technical area of interest, or specific identity or affinity groups.

Module 4 students (and occasionally Module 3 students) will take the lead in the Mix It Up groups, sharing their experiences so far approaching different topics, providing advice for other students, and sharing resources. [See more specific directions for Mod 4 leaders here](/mixed_groups/mixed_mod4_directions). Everyone will have a chance to participate though!

Here are some potential topics:

* [Networking](/mixed_groups/mixed_networking_prompts)
* [Interviewing](/mixed_groups/mixed_interviewing_prompts)
* [Materials](/mixed_groups/mixed_materials_prompts)
* [Job Search Strategies](/mixed_groups/mixed_jss_prompts)
* [Negotiations](/mixed_groups/mixed_negotiations_prompts)
* [Specific technical interest](/mixed_groups/mixed_tech_interest_prompts)
* [Specific industry interest](/mixed_groups/mixed_industry_interest_prompts)
* [Identifying as someone less represented in tech](/mixed_groups/mixed_less_represented_prompts)

### How will we come together?
You'll be put into a Slack group with your other Mix It Up group members, and you will join a breakout room from the Mod 4 SLC zoom account. Check that Slack group for those specific details.
