title: Mix It Up
---

## Overview
In addition to the Homeroom Groups with your cohortmates, you also have an opportunity to meet with and collaborate with students across modules and across programs -- we call this Mix It Up! On Wednesdays in Weeks 2 and 4, you'll be assigned a group of students across the Turing program to meet with.

### Why do this?
Our data shows that student collaboration and connection is a strong indicator of a quick and satisfactory job search. Meeting others within Turing allows you to strengthen your bonds to the community and network in a low-stress environment. 

### What will you talk about?

* [Week 2](/mixed_groups/mixed_week2_prompts) will focus on Meeting You Right Now: Balancing PD and the Job Search while in Mods 1-4. Your group will discuss things like:
    * Time management and effective habits
    * Resiliency in the face of rejection
    * Self-care

* [Week 4](/mixed_groups/mixed_week4_prompts) will focus on Looking Ahead: Identifying Goals & Working Towards a Successful Job Search. Your group will discuss things like:
    * Mod 4 students' experiences with PD and advice they have for lower mods
    * Reflecting on wins for time management and progress in your PD this mod
    * Creating feasible goals to work towards for the rest of the module
    * Discuss challenges to be aware of, resources you can share with each other, and first steps to take

In both conversations, you'll spend time getting to know each other and setting basic norms. The norms that the Career Development Team urge you to adopt are:

* **Make space.** Everyone should be given a chance to share.
* **Be present.** Take a break from your projects and show up to this conversation.
* **Make this time valuable.** What intention can you set for your time today? How can you demonstrate that you value the other students in your group? How can they let you know that they value you?

### How will you meet?
The Career Dev team will send out a spreadsheet listing everyone's groups and their group number. We will use the Mod 4 SLC zoom account, and you will go to the breakout room that corresponds with your group number.
