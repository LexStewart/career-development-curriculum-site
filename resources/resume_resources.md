## Create an ATS-ready Resume
An ATS, or applicant tracking system, is used by most companies to screen resumes. Each ATS system is different, but there are a few key components to keep in mind when creating a resume that is optimized for ATS systems:

* Use a Word doc or a Google Doc (which can be downloaded as a Word doc) to use as your main copy. Not all ATS systems can read PDFs.
* Use a single column. 
* Compare your resume to the job description and pull out key words to highlight in your skills and experience
* Need some inspiration? Check out these [free resume templates from JobScan](https://www.jobscan.co/resume-templates)

## Resume Templates
Note: not all of these are ATS-ready. You can use one of the templates below for a "stylized" resume that can go on your [Terminal portfolio](https://terminal.turing.edu) or to send individually, but make sure to have a plainer, ATS-ready copy made in Word or Google Docs.
