## Week 1 Lesson - Developer Identity: Understanding Your Strengths
### Lesson Plan (10 mins)
Please [watch this video lecture]()

### Introduction
For our first lesson in Mod 1, let's talk about why we're starting with discussing strengths. The core of developing yourself professionally is *understanding yourself* and *being able to speak to to that understanding.* You have to understand yourself in order to know what you're striving towards professionally as well as how to advocate for what you want.

These abilities will not only help you at Turing and serve as the foundation for your job search by helping you:

* Create a concise elevator pitch
* Have a compelling answer to “tell me about yourself” question
* Engage & connect with others
* Create a powerful statement or summary for your resume, LinkedIn and alumni profiles

How can we activate our strengths in order to use them for these purposes? Use the 3 C's as a framework:

1. **Clarify**: Take the time to learn what your strengths are.
2. **Communicate:** Share your strengths effectively in-person conversations, on paper, and online 
3. **Capitalize:** Find opportunities that will showcase your strengths. Consider:
    * What kind of role can you take on in project groups?
    * How could you showcase your strengths in the Turing community?
    * How will your strengths help you as a member of your cohort?

We'll utilize this framework to build an understanding of your strengths today to serve as a foundation for all of your professional development at Turing.
