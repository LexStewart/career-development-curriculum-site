Every Wednesday afternoon, you'll meet with other students to discuss and collaborate on your professional development. Read through the overview on the [Homeroom Groups page](/student_discussion_groups/index) to understand what this will look like.

### Repeating the Module
For students repeating Module 1, they are not required to attend workshops again unless they would like to. Instead, they will create specific goals to work on during the module [using this plan](/module_one/m1_PD_repeat_plan). They will continue to meet with their Homeroom and Mix It Up groups on Wednesday afternoons.
