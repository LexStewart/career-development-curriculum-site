title: Turing Career Development - Mod 1 Prework
---

The Career Development prework is divided into 4 sections and shouldn't take more than 2 hours to complete. 

### Part I: Career Development Overview (15 mins)
The objective of the Career Development Team is for all Turing students to have the skills and abilities to pursue full-time employment in high fulfillment technical careers upon graduation. To do this, our curriculum focuses on five specific competencies:

* **Networking:** Using outreach and networking strategies to make connections in the software industry to support a student’s job search
* **Interviewing:** The skills needed to thoroughly respond to behavioral interview questions, articulate technical process, and demonstrate technical knowledge through code challenges
* **Materials:** A student’s branding materials that showcase their work for employers, i.e., LinkedIn, resume, portfolio, cover letter
* **Job Search Strategies:** A student’s understanding of their own goals and creating a set of steps to achieve them
* **Negotiations:** Understanding software industry market rates for compensation and the resources needed to negotiate for competitive rates

You can find all information on the curriculum and job search support on the [Career Development site](https://careerdev.turing.edu)

**Action Items to Complete:**
1. Bookmark the [Career Development site](https://careerdev.turing.edu). You will also be able to find this site again from both the [Backend Curriculum site](https://backend.turing.edu) and the [Frontend Curriculum site](https://frontend.turing.edu). Spend a few minutes browsing around the site and make note of:
    * The Career Dev Team mission statement and Team members on the homepage
    * The [Module 1 section](/module_one/index), which includes lessons, activities, and information on your learning goals for Mod 1
    * The [Resources section](/resources/index). Here you can find links, videos, and documents to help you with specific areas of support in the job search.
    * The [Homeroom Groups](/student_discussion_groups/index) and [Mix It Up](/mixed_groups/index) information. Within your cohort, you'll be put into a small group to work on PD activities and discussion together as a way to foster collaboration weekly. Twice a mod, you'll also be put into groups mixed across program and cohorts to meet others in the Turing community and share resources based on specific topics.
    * The [Module 5 section](/module-5/index), which covers what job search support looks like once you've graduated from Turing.

### Part II: Pairin Survey (15-20 mins)
One tool we'll be using for your professional development at Turing is the [Pairin Survey](https://www.pairin.com/). This survey measures over 100 coachable and changeable skills. This activity invites you to begin building an understanding of how learning about and developing your strengths applies to your success in your new career. We will discuss the results of this survey more in-depth in your first professional development session at Turing. 

**Action Items to Complete:**
1. Take the survey using [this link](https://survey.pairin.com/signup/15960/student). It will prompt you to create an account when you take it. There are 2 sections for this survey:
   * First section: Choose adjectives to answer _how you currently are_
   * Second section: Choose adjectives to answer _how you would like to be_. The second section is marked as "optional," but it is highly recommended that you fill out this section in order to provide more data for you on how you'd like to grow. The survey should take you about 15-20 minutes.
  
2. Create a gist to include a screenshot of your Pairin top 4 results by following these directions:

* Log in to your GitHub account
* In the upper right corner, click on the ‘+’ icon
* Select ‘New Gist’
* Enter a filename, with the extension .md
* Enter the text of your gist in the large text area
* Click Create Secret Gist
* You can also visit [gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com/)
