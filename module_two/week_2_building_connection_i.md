### Learning Goals
* Understand how to refine your job search strategy to include research and networking
* Utilize tools and strategies for successful outreach
* Create and execute a plan for your own outreach and networking this week  

### Why Outreach?
You'll hear us say over and over again that networking is all about  “Networking is transactional.”

Reframe: “Networking is merely asking for directions.”


Focus on how networking can be a form of research
What do I want to learn?
Who is best to answer these questions?
Provide context with where they are at in the program and how networking can be experiential learning by nature
What Does it look like?
Walk through LinkedIn and demo ways to connect with alumni and companies
Show how to follow companies
Advise students to look at profiles of devs based on interest and what companies they have worked at both past present and future 
Go to BuiltIn and showcase the information on the company directory as an additional resource to a starting point
If you have additional resources to showcase be sure to demo to students 
Collaboration and Brainstorming 
Open to change
