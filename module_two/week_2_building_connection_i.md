### Learning Goals
* Understand how to refine your job search strategy to include research and networking
* Utilize tools and strategies for successful outreach
* Create and execute a plan for your own outreach and networking this week  

### Why Outreach?
You'll hear us talk about networking as an essential component to the job search, but it can feel uncomfortable for many. You might think to yourself: "I don't want to bother them" or "How do I talk to them without coming across like I'm asking for a job?" Instead of thinking about networking as being transactional, think about it like any other relationship -- it's about connection. 

Furthermore, networking have different purposes. In this session, we're going to focus on how networking can be a form of research. Think to yourself: what do I want to learn? Who is best to answer these questions?
