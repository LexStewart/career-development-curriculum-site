title: Module 2 Professional Development
---

## Overview
Our approach to Mod 2 is to build on the competencies covered in Mod 1 so that students can create a more specific networking plan and learn more about what software development looks like so that they can more clearly define their goals.

Find more specifics here on [Mod 2 Key Learning Goals & Outcomes](/module_two/mod2_learning_goals).

### Weekly Discussion Guidelines & Prompts
Every Wednesday afternoon, you'll meet with other students to discuss and collaborate on your professional development. Read through the overview on the [Homeroom Groups page](/student_discussion_groups/index) to understand what this will look like. Homeroom groups are with your cohort only and happen in Weeks 1-5 while Mix It Up groups are groups that are mixed across the entire student body and happen in Weeks 2 and 4.

### Repeating the Module
For students repeating Module 2, they are not required to attend workshops again unless they would like to. Instead, they will create specific goals to work on during the module [using this plan](/module_two/m2_pd_repeat_plan). They will continue to meet with their Homeroom and Mix It Up groups on Wednesday afternoons.
